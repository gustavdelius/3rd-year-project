## Fish Stomach Records

In this document I will be looking at the DAPSTOM database by the people at CEFAS. It can be found at <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Full_Archive/3529112>, and is an ongoing initiative to digitise and make available fish stomach records spanning the past 100 years. 

In order to analyse this data, I first need to read the csv file into R.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
Fish <- read.csv("cefas_arctic_cruises_and_catches_1930_1959.csv")
```

Next, I will make a plot of the shot depth against the catch weight, to see if the depth at which they fish has an affect on the amount of fish caught.


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = Fish) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = ShotDepth, y = CatchWeight))
```
